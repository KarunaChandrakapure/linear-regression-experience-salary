# 📈 Linear Regression: Experience vs Salary Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of **Simple Linear Regression** to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore the relationship between **Years of Experience** and **Salary**.
- Build a **Simple Linear Regression Model**.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like **R² Score**, **RMSE**, and visualize the results.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**:Salary Dataset - Simple linear regression (Kaggle)
- **Columns**:
  - `YearsExperience`: Number of years of work experience.
  - `Salary`: Annual salary in USD (or assumed currency).

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Understand the data shape, summary, and distribution.
2. **Data Visualization**
   - Scatter plot of Experience vs Salary.
3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Apply **Simple Linear Regression**.
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculate **R² Score**, **RMSE**.
   - Visualize actual vs predicted salaries.
5. **Interpret Results**
   - Analyze slope (coefficient) and intercept.
   - Assess model performance and limitations.

---

## 📝 Results

- **Slope (Coefficient)**:  9423.815 
- **Intercept**:  24380.201
- **R² Score on Test Data**:  0.90  
- **RMSE**: ₹7059.043

> The model shows a strong linear relationship between experience and salary, but errors indicate variability not captured by the simple model.
